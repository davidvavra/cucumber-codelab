# Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Write a mapping to your favorite language from file `calculator.feature`. Pick your favorite language and [download Cucumber for your platform](https://cucumber.io/docs).
    - For Java/Kotlin [setup this](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm#java) and use JUnit Runner - it can be run from IntelliJ/Android Studio or from `./gradlew test` (as any other JUnit tests)
    - For ObjC/Swift [setup this](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish)
3. Write an implementation (simple calculator with two numbers and 4 operators) in your favorite language and connect it to tests
    - If you will create Android/iOS app, it doesn't need to have any UI, just test some static class with the logic
5. Run tests and make sure they are all green    
4. Add one test with different data and make sure the tests are still green
